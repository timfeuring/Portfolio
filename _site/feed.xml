&lt;p&gt;Coal mining is history in Germany. A tradition looking back on hundreds of years of development is coming to an end. „Kohledampfer“ is a unique beer, brewed in small circulation for the graduation project of a brewers class in Dortmund, Germany. The historic background of the region regarding the omnipresent mining industry inspired the young brewers for creating a beer that pays tribute to the miners and their struggle and keeps their memory alive. For this purpose, they created a porter - black like the coal in a mine. Mining is closely connected to seafare historically - from this, the name and motive „Kohledampfer“ (roughly translates to steamboat) derived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the graduation project of the brewers, I developed a label as well as a logo mark and an illustration to represent the historic background and convey the mood of a typical hard-working miner. Black as coal in a mine, the beer appears - straightforward and direct, just like the miners of the past.

Early Antiqua printing fonts evolved from this style. The word minimum is a good practice for getting a feeling for the spacing of letters, which plays an essential role in typography.

&lt;p&gt;To bring these values closer into our focus and to have fun exploring the wide possibilities of gardening in an engaging and open environment, is the goal of the community garden project in Vechta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created an exciting logo solution using a combination of iconography and typography to communicate the playful, open-minded and positive character of the community gardening project in Vechta and the people behind it.
