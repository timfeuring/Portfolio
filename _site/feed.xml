&lt;p&gt;I spend a lot of my free time with different art and design topics, including drawing and illustrating. I especially enjoy the vintage look and feel classic pen and ink illustrations evoke, as they distill to the necessary visual elements and techniques.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="Illustration" /><summary type="html">Inspired by wandering around the mud flats and watching birds on a vacation by the north sea, I drew this illustration of a shorebird.

&lt;p&gt;Coal mining is history in Germany. A tradition looking back on hundreds of years of development is coming to an end. „Kohledampfer“ is a unique beer, brewed in small circulation for the graduation project of a brewers class in Dortmund, Germany. The historic background of the region regarding the omnipresent mining industry inspired the young brewers for creating a beer that pays tribute to the miners and their struggle and keeps their memory alive. For this purpose, they created a porter - black like the coal in a mine. Mining is closely connected to seafare historically - from this, the name and motive „Kohledampfer“ (roughly translates to steamboat) derived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the graduation project of the brewers, I developed a label as well as a logo mark and an illustration to represent the historic background and convey the mood of a typical hard-working miner. Black as coal in a mine, the beer appears - straightforward and direct, just like the miners of the past.

&lt;p&gt;To bring these values closer into our focus and to have fun exploring the wide possibilities of gardening in an engaging and open environment, is the goal of the community garden project in Vechta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After exploring different directions, it became clear that it had to be a typography-inspired approach with a rather bold look. I started sketching out several ideas on paper, and in the end came up with an arrangement of letters and shapes that end up fitting together in a perfect square. I transferred the analog design to digital and refined it furthermore. We ended up screen printing laptop-bags, shirts and hoodies in a variety of sizes and colors - some of which can be seen below.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="Logo creation" /><summary type="html">SinnerSchrader Swipe is a Studio specialized in creating awesome mobile experiences.
