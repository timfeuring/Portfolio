            Iâ€™m a digital and analog designer based in Hamburg. Currently vocational trainee at digital agency SinnerSchrader, fascinated to learn about a dozen subjects of design craftsmenship. Possibly a bit nerdy on lettering. My guilty pleasure is hoarding more art supplies than I could ever use up and getting my hands dirty with ink.
