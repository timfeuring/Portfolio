The art of calligraphy, handlettering and typography in general are one of my favorite subjects in design. Whether it is in my daily work as a designer or my free time - composition, the practical execution and details of letters as well as readability and the conveying of meaning and emotions (the list could go on) are things I enjoy dealing with.
