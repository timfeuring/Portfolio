<i>"I'm so happy to have you in my life!"</i> 


That's a thing we should tell our loved ones way more often. For that purpose, I created this little card with a custom lettering. When did you last tell someone that they are important to you? Call them right now and bring a smile on their face. 

Bonus: you'll feel great afterwards, I promise :)
