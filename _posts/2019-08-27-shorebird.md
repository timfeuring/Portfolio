Inspired by wandering around the mud flats and watching birds on a vacation by the north sea, I drew this illustration of a shorebird. It is made by pen and ink and was directly scanned from my sketchbook. 

I spend a lot of my free time with different art and design topics, including drawing and illustrating. I especially enjoy the vintage look and feel classic pen and ink illustrations evoke, as they distill to the necessary visual elements and techniques.
