The Sauerwein family of winemakers have a small winery business in Rheinland-Pfalz. As starting with exploring different shape ideas, I started sketching out stuff. After a phase of sketching and exploring, the initial arrangement of letters was set and things went to digital. This project evolved from a grizzly bear dancing in his underpants.
