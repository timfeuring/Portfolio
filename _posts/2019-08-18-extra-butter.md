Adding a little bit of Extra Butter on top.

Extra Butter is a custom, hand-designed logotype project of mine. 
From initial lettering as a pencil-sketch to refined vector artwork, it evolved to its final, playful look. It was later on used for screen-printing and now embellishes diverse clothes and fabrics from shirts to shopping bags.
