  This project evolved from a grizzly bear dancing in his underpants. The goal was to create a unique logomark for our design studio at SinnerSchrader Swipe. Starting with exploring different shape ideas, I started sketching out stuff. After a phase of sketching and exploring, the initial arrangement of letters was set and things went to digital.
