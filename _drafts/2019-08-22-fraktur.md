The calligraphy „Fraktur“ evolved as a free project and mainly served the purpose of exploring and training my typographic abilities. It was made by hand with a broad-edged pen. Here you can see a gothic calligraphy, also called fraktur. The name „fraktur“ derives from its letterforms, which are edged, giving the letter a broken or fractured look. This font style was widely spread among writers and in book printing in Europe. Gothic fonts were common reading fonts in books or newspapers up until the 20th century. Today, they are usually not used in reading contexts anymore.

The art of calligraphy, handlettering and typography in general are one of my favorite subjects in design. Whether it is in my daily work as a designer or my free time - composition, the practical execution and details of letters as well as readability and the conveying of meaning and emotions (the list could go on) are things I enjoy dealing with.
