              Wohnglück is a digital platform that supports homeowners and renters across topics like home renovation, financing, sustainable energy, and real estate services. With a growing service ecosystem, the platform needed a more refined, engaging, and consistent digital experience.

                My work as a UI Designer in an interdisciplinary team ranged from storytelling visuals to UI rebrush and management of the design system, as well as developing user flows for web services.
