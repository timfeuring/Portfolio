                  <br>
                  I'm a multifaceted designer with a passion for both digital innovation  and traditional craftsmanship, based in Hamburg.
                  With 4+ years of agency experience and a profound education in Media and Communication Design, 
                  I have cultivated my skills in  digital, identity-related, and handcrafted design solutions. 
                  I believe in the power of design to change things for the better, following  user-centric and empathetic approaches.
                  <br><br>
                  Iâ€™ve developed digital solutions for major clients including Motel One, Audi, and BASF, as well as smaller scale projects and handcrafted visuals for individual clients. My work is characterized by an eye for detail and a deep understanding  of both design principles and technical execution â€“ as an extra, I know all the magic Figma shortcuts to bring these designs to life effectively ðŸ’«
